# The Chimera Company - UX Writing & Content Guide

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Attributes
- **Luxury**: Elevated, refined, sophisticated — never stuffy
- **Calm**: Confident, composed, unhurried — never rushed
- **Confident**: Authoritative, assured, expert — never arrogant  
- **Human**: Warm, personal, authentic — never robotic

### Writing Principles
1. **Intentional over impressive** - Every word serves a purpose
2. **Show don't tell** - Demonstrate expertise through specificity
3. **Active over passive** - "We design" not "Events are designed"
4. **Concrete over vague** - "24 hours" not "soon"
5. **Confident simplicity** - Short, powerful sentences

### What We Say vs. Don't Say

✅ **Do Say**:
- "Bespoke experiences"
- "Curated with purpose"
- "Executed with precision"
- "Detail, discretion, and distinction"
- "Effortlessly elegant"
- "Intentional design"

❌ **Don't Say**:
- "Award-winning" (unless true and relevant)
- "World-class" (overused)
- "Unforgettable memories" (cliché)
- "Dream wedding" (generic)
- "Stress-free" (every planner says this)
- "Magical" (Disney, not us)
